Tree Exdeath:
  Metadata:
    next-node: ned
    previous-nodes:
    - necrophobe
  Generic:
  - "49001 HP. Starts with regular attacks and White Hole (inflicts both petrify and death, blocked by immunity to either)."
  - "Adds Holy and Condemn below 30,000 HP, then does nothing but Meteor and Fight below 10,000 HP. Rush that last 10K HP, because Meteor hurts."
  - "Spawns Neo-Exdeath upon death. Don't do anything to break that script, like Kiss of Blessing, !Counter, or Vulner Cannon."
  Bard:
  - "This fight continues into NED, so Bards can use the time to go capped-stats Super Saiyan now."
  - "White Hole can put a wrench in that plan - if you have the time to kill, you can !Hide until Exdeath runs out of MP, or just leave two non-singers while the other two !Sing."
  - "Also worth noting that for some reason, EXDEATH'S PHYSICAL ATTACKS DO NOT BREAK !SING (on SNES and GBA.) (on Pixel and Matrix, you're fine to ignore this next bit.)"
  - "So don't put all four party members into songs, and likely not even three because an unlucky White Hole or physical will effectively wipe you."
  Time-Mage:
  - "For some reason, the tree is not immune to Slow. Enjoy."
  Chemist:
  - "Yes, yes, on SNES you can use Kiss of Blessing to stop NED from spawning and thus skip the final boss. Gold star. Don't."
  - "This fight continues into NED, so Chemists can use the time to build up into immune-to-everything-level-255 Super Saiyan form now."
  Shield:
  - "Aegis Shield blocks White Hole completely, so have it on your most useful character."
  INTERSECTION White-Mage Red-Mage:
  - "This fight continues into NED, so Shell and Protect on the party will carry over."
  Dancer:
  - "Don't be fooled by it being a tree, it's actually a Human. Feel free to Eat the Man."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Mighty Guard. Mightguardmightyguardmightyguard. You can even facetank Meteor with it. And it carries over into NED."
  - "Treedeath's a lot less threatening once you successfully land Dark Spark once and follow it up with Level 2 Old."
  - "You also have Magic Hammer to drain all its MP before pushing to Meteor phase (which stops White Hole as well)... but this is likely too cute, just kill it."
  Ninja:
  - "Now is probably be a good time to !Throw all those legendary weapons, if you're having trouble burning the last 10k HP."
  - "Alternatively, save them for burning down the last part of NED later. But this is just as good, honestly. The last 10k HP is a threatening phase."
  Cannoneer:
  - "Don't do anything cute. Anything that bypasses counters will skip NED's spawn just like the Kiss of Blessing glitch."
  - "However, you can inflict Slow just fine, since for some reason this first part of the literal final boss is not immune to Slow."
  Monk:
  - "Killing with a !Counter will skip NED, which... honestly, is impressive, but not recommended."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Hold your Dragon Aevises for NED."
  - "Don't be fooled by it being a tree, it's actually flying which in Pixel means whips deal double damage in addition to always hitting. Unless you proc Firaga with the Fire Lash, whips won't match the Chicken Knife but it'll do very respectable damage."
  Ranger:
  - "Treedeath is flying which means in Pixel bows deal double damage in addition to always hitting. !Rapid Fire with a Yoichi Bow and at least one crit will outdamage the Chicken Knife, without any crits you have damage nearly on par."
  Freelancer:
  - "In Pixel, Treedeath counts as flying, which makes bows and whips deal double damage in addition to always hitting. With the right Equip ability mastered, equipping a Yoichi's Bow will match a Chicken Knife's damage without any crits."

Island Shrine:
  Metadata:
    next-node: stokker

    - airship_w3
  Generic:
  - "Consider carefully whether you actually need to do the various optional World 3 dungeons. Most parties don't!"
  - "The Island Shrine is required for Fork Tower, therefore also the Deep Sea Trench and Istory Falls."
  INTERSECTION Cannoneer Gladiator Oracle Mime:
  - "And yes, this means it's mandatory to unlock Mime, Cannoneer, Gladiator, and/or Oracle. Sorry."
  Thief:
  - "The Island Shrine contains the Rising Sun, the best Thief-only weapon in the game (but you probably don't care.)"
  - "Additional Mirage Vests, which grant natural Blink, can be rarely stolen from Oiseaurares in the Shrine as well."
  UNION Thief Shield:
  - "You can rare steal more Ice Shields from Numb Blades here, if you have a use for them. Stokker in here may be one, but there's probably not another one."
  - "Especially when Gorgimera in the Void have a rare steal Aegis Shield instead for the same amount of effort."
  Beastmaster:
  - "If you're coming here for other reasons anyway, the Beast Killer whip (2x damage vs Magic Beasts) is pretty good for a few later fights, including the Almagest piece of the final boss."

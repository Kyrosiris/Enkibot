  Generic:
  - "Try not to die to the Exdeath's Soul and Shield Dragon encounters in the lobby, they're a cut above most encounter trash."
  - "You'll have the choice of 3 legendary weapons at first in the Sealed Castle, plus 3 more per tablet."
  - "The Assassin's Dagger is the only truly multiclass one, but it's excellent (if nothing else, it murders Twintania)."
  Freelancer:
  - "Freelancer gets to go shopping here. Take the Dagger in your first set (probably), but you have so many of options! In rough order of power:"
  - "Masamune is dumb. Guaranteed initiative (first action in every combat) + use as an item to cast Haste. Especially fun with !Flee or !Smoke to bail instantly."
  - "Excalibur has the highest raw Power of any easily obtainable weapon and is Holy elemental, which is usually upside (but not against Shinryu or Minotaur.)"
  - "The Rune Axe runs off your not-Berserker-level magic stat, so it hits like a truck and also ignores a bunch of the target's defense."
  - "Yoichi's Bow hits hard, and its 30% critical hit rate ignores defense when it procs."
  - "Apollo's Harp is really good against dragons, so you may want it with your second+ set of tablets if you're hunting Shinryu."
  - "Sasuke's Katana has pretty high attack power and a 1/3 physical attack block rate, like a Main Gauche on steroids."
  - "The Sage's Staff is Holy elemental like Excalibur, and can also be used to infinitely cast Raise for free."
  - "The Magus Rod boosts every element (except water and holy), which does nothing for Freelancer on its own. If you want it, you already know that you want it."
  - "The Holy Lance is like Excalibur, except strictly worse. The Fire Lash sucks. The Gaia Bell is worse."
  Knight: 
  - "Excalibur has the highest Power of any easily obtainable weapon and is Holy elemental. No-brainer for Knights. Just don't hit Shinryu or Minotaur with it." 
  Ninja:
  - "Sasuke's Katana is fairly good, especially if your Ninja isn't your Chicken Knife user. High power and a 1/3 physical attack block rate like the Main Gauche from W1."
  Dragoon:
  - "The Holy Lance is a solid option for your Dragoon, or at least as good as the poor soul will get at this point in the game."
  - "Just don't use it against Shinryu or Minotaur because they absorb Holy elemental."
  Berserker:
  - "The Rune Axe is a mediocre choice for your Berserker... unless you have a magic-stat-granting secondary ability, in which case it's amazing."
  Samurai:
  - "Masamune is dumb dumb dumb. Guaranteed initiative + use to cast Haste. Especially funny with !Flee or !Smoke. Get it."
  Ranger:
  - "Yoichi's Bow hits like a truck, and is capable of critical hits, which still happen with !Rapid Fire."
  - "It's no Chicken Knife, but it's miles better than at least half of the other stuff here."
  Bard:
  - "Apollo's Harp is kind of niche, but it's not a bad choice for your third weapon if you have no better options."
  UNION Bard Chemist:
  - "Chemists have the ability to turn things into dragons so Apollo's Harp can wreck them, which is both funny and surprisingly powerful."
  Break-Rods:
  - "Any rod-using class can equip the Magus Rod, but it's best on Black or Red Mages that can actually take advantage of its elemental boosts."
  - "(Summoners can still use the Air Knife to boost Syldra if someone else needs the rod)."
  Staff:
  - "Very few staff-using classes have a use for the Sage's Staff beyond the free Raise casts, frankly."
  White-Mage:
  - "It does boost Holy damage for your White Mage, so when you get Holy later it becomes their best weapon."
  Chemist:
  - "Attacking with the Sage's Staff lets you butcher Exdeath's Souls right outside for Dark Matter drops. This is actually kind of nice."
  Beastmaster:
  - "The Fire Lash is basically garbage, though it out-performs the other two end-game whips if they're not hitting a monster-type weakness."
  Geomancer:
  - "The Gaia Bell is actually garbage."
  Gladiator:
  - "Don't forget that Gladiator can wield Excalibur! Make it happen."
  - "It can also wield the Holy Lance! It's like Excalibur, except strictly worse without !Jump."
  Cannoneer:
  - "Your awesome GBA job does not care about any of these weapons. It's still awesome."
  Oracle:
  - "You can use the Sage's Staff just as well as anyone else that isn't a White Mage!"
  - "...as in, poorly."

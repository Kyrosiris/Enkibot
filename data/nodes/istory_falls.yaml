Istory Falls:
  Metadata:
    next-node: leviathan
    previous-nodes:
    - stooges
  Generic:
  - "Istory Falls isn't useless per se. There's a lot of good loot in here, but it rarely makes or breaks a run."
  INTERSECTION Cannoneer Gladiator Oracle:
  - "It is, however, mandatory to unlock Cannoneer, Gladiator, and Oracle."
  Summoner:
  - "Summoners learn Leviathan here which is... completely useless due to the lack of water-boosting weapons."
  UNION Summoner Chemist:
  - "...unless you have Chemist, whose Elemental Power mix can actually boost Water spells. EP Leviathan is the second strongest spell - and strongest AoE - in the game."
  INTERSECTION Blue-Mage Red-Mage:
  - "The Enhancer available in Istory Falls boosts Magic for the Blue and Red Mages that can equip it... but not elements, just the raw Magic stat, so you probably don't care."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "The Enhancer available in Istory Falls is the best Spellblade-compatible weapon that's not the Chicken Knife."
  - "That said, A) you probably will be using the Chicken Knife, B) there's a single free Enhancer in a chest in the Rift Forest, and C) if you need more, you can rare steal additional Enhancers in the Rift Castle with the Thief Knife."
  Ranger:
  - "Rangers can get the Artemis Bow here, which is still worse than !Rapid Fire with the Chicken Knife."
  - "However, if you've got a second !Rapid Fire user taking up your Chicken Knife, it's probably the best option."
  - "Notably, it does bonus damage against Magic Beasts, including the Almagest piece of the final boss."
  UNION Monk Ranger:
  - "If you're playing Pixel and didn't get one already from the Pyramid, get a Kaiser Knuckles drop from Steel Fists here rather than going to the Deep Sea Trench, especially if you have no other reason to go there. B3 is the best place to farm for them."
  - "A Monk equipped with it that uses !Rapid Fire will ignore the damage-halving penalty and deal 8 full power fist strikes, in addition to boosting their unarmed power and !Kick in general."
  - "This supercharges Monk's offense and gives you a better shot against Omega."
  Shield:
  - "The second Aegis Shield is probably the reason you're here. Don't forget you can Thief's Knife it rarely from Gorgimeras in the Void instead if that's the ONLY reason you're here."
  - "That said, if you had to do Fork Tower anyway to unlock Mime, or a GBA job, or for Holy or Flare or something, sure, grab it!"

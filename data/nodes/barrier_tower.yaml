  Generic:
  - "Almost every party should farm Reflect Knights for their Reflect Ring drops here. You'll likely need them for World 2 Exdeath."
  - "The best place to farm them is outside between floors 5 and 6, but if you need to return to the sub to heal frequently the balcony between 3 and 4 is pretty good too."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Blue-Mage Red-Mage Summoner Time-Mage White-Mage:
  - "Since you have a caster job, make sure to also get the Gold Hairpin in a trapped chest on the left side of Floor 9. It cuts the wearer's MP consumption in half."
  UNION Ranger Knight:
  - "Blood Sword is usually useless thanks to its low damage and hit rate, but !Rapid Fire always hits and does the full damage with all 4 attacks."
  UNION Ranger Freelancer:
  - "Blood Sword is usually useless thanks to its low damage and hit rate, but !Rapid Fire always hits and does the full damage with all 4 attacks."
  - "With just Ranger stats, the Sword is probably the best weapon for this in World 2. If you also have a good magic stat passed to your Freelancer, it's competitive with Excalibur."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Blue Mages can learn Time Slip from Travelers, though it's of somewhat limited utility since it requires targets to be vulnerable to both Sleep and Old."
  - "...except, on Pixel, Time Slip will inflict the single status that the target is vulnerable to rather than getting blocked by a single immunity. This is much better, so you likely want it."
  - "Level Trickers can cast Level 4 Graviga here, if you missed it from Ronka. But it's useless, so whatever."
  Thief:
  - "Thieves can rare !Steal Flame Rings from the Red Dragons in the Gold Hairpin and Blood Sword chests."
  - "Remember, you can flee from a monster-in-a-box to reset the encounter if you get the common !Steal item instead of the rare one."
  - "...or if you're crazy and want 4 of them (or even more to sell for gil)."
  White-Mage:
  - "You have access to the spell Reflect, though that has a duration. You can skip Reflect Rings if you want. I would recommend one to make life marginally easier against Catastrophe, but there's no need."
  Blue-Mage`:
  - "You will have access to Level 2 Old -> Level 5 Death to one-shot W2 Exdeath, so you can safely skip Reflect Rings altogether. Maybe get one for Catastrophe."
  Summoner:
  - "You get Carbuncle before you need Reflect, so you don't need Reflect Rings if you're feeling bold. That said, you might want one to make Catastrophe even more trivial."
  Beastmaster:
  - "You have !Release to kill W2 Exdeath, and can safely skip Reflect Rings altogether. Maybe get one for Catastrophe, since !Release is a lousy (if functional) source of Float."
  Chemist:
  - "Since you have Chemist, you don't need Reflect Rings for W2 Exdeath, though they're still nice."
  - "Be sure to get one if you're going to use !Mix to go toe-to-toe with Omega! That's mandatory."
  Black-Mage:
  - "Drain bypasses Reflect, so you can farm your first Reflect Ring with Drain and then bounce Breaks off your own party to speed up the rest."
  Thief`:
  - "No point in Thieves farming Reflect Rings here. You can steal one from Carbuncle plus three from Reflect Mages more easily."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "You can kill Reflect Knights with Break Blade. Reflect Rings are easy for you!"
  Time-Mage:
  - "You can kill Reflect Knights with Comet. Reflect Rings are not very difficult for you!"
  Bard:
  - "Like many encounters, the Reflect Knights are not immune to Romeo's Ballad. Just Stop and murder. Not so bad."

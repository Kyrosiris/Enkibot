  - "You may want to pick up a rare drop Rune Chime from the Baldanders in the Ruins area. (The room with three chains has the highest encounter rate for them.)"
  - "It boosts every element! This is... sometimes slightly useful, even though Air Knife is often functionally equivalent."
  Generic`:
  - "Three things."
  - "Get the Coral/Angel Rings in the Caves."

  - "...what's the third one there? uh, not the EPA."

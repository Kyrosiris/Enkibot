  Generic:
    - "If you're doing a Fifth Job run, now's the time that you get your fifth job. Here are some tips that may help with whatever you have now that you didn't have previously:"
  Knight:
    - "There's a free Great Sword in the Bal castle moat, but you can also just grab some nice stuff in the next dungeon instead."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, so if you want it and didn't already get it from Drakenvale, do so."
  Monk:
    - "Now you have a Monk."
    - "I guess they can wear Bone Mail. Meh."
    - "If you have a good Equip ability in Pixel, then hand your Monk your strongest weapon and use !Kick to at least clear out trash with decent AoE damage."
  Thief:
    - "You will be able to steal Reflect Rings in the next dungeon."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, so if you want it and didn't already get it from Drakenvale, do so."
  Black-Mage:
    - "Don't forget to go buy spells. Moore has Firaga/Blizzaga/Thundaga/Drain/Break/Bio."
  White-Mage:
    - "Don't forget to go buy spells. Moore has Curaga/Reflect/Berserk/Shell/Esuna/Blink."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "You missed plenty of opportunities to learn things... but there are many more. Here's a quick couple of spells to get before you move on:"
    - "Dark Spark from Strapparer and Death Claw from Treant, both on the overworld outside Meatfort."
    - "If you don't want to wait for Magic Dragons inside Meatfort, get Aeroga by backtracking to Ghido's Cave (from the Metamorph that turns into an Enchanted Fan.)"
    - "(And, if you're on GBA, also grab Vampire from a Dark Aspic while you're in Ghido's Cave. If not, it's not bugged in your favor, so don't bother.)"
    - "BLU is the best Bone Mail user. So if you didn't already, go get it from Drakenvale, since you can heal the wearer with White Wind once you get it."
  UNION Inflict-Confuse Blue-Mage:
    - "You now have a good source of Confuse to grab White Wind in Meatfort. Just telling you now so that you don't forget in a few minutes when you get there."
  Berserker:
    - "Please enjoy Krile's cute Berserker costume."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, so if you want it and didn't already get it from Drakenvale, do so."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "If you didn't buy spells already, the Moore black magic vendor has Firaga/Blizzaga/Thundaga/Drain/Break/Bio for your new !Spellblade."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, so if you want it and didn't already get it from Drakenvale, do so."
    - "There's a free Great Sword in the Bal castle moat if you need a weapon."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Don't forget to go buy spells. Moore has Comet/Hastega/Slowga/Old/Return/Graviga."
    - "If you didn't already do the library puzzle in Surgate, go do that to get Float."
  Summoner:
    - "Don't forget about Golem in the random encounter on the last screen of Drakenvale. He's incredible, and absolutely worth going back for."
    - "You can also go get Catoblepas with the submarine. I have never cast Catoblepas in my life, but if you want to roll the dice on petrifying that one part of the final boss, go for it."
  Red-Mage:
    - "Red Mage, unlike other mages, gets absolutely nothing at this exact moment in time. You actually cannot buy the level 1-3 spells in World 2 at all."
    - "There's a free Great Sword in the Bal castle moat, and that's about the best you can do for this poor soul with a good hat."
    - "If you truly have no spells or rods available for your Red Mage, you can double back to Quelb to buy some Poison Rods and snap them."
    - "Equip a Poison Rod in Pixel while snapping another to boost its damage. You'll need it."
    - "Otherwise if you still have a stock of elemental rods from Karnak, just snap those."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, but Red Mage doesn't really have any reason to be doing that kind of thing."
  Beastmaster:
    - "Go get the Kornago Gourd from the old man in the well in Quelb."
    - "There's also the Hypno Crown in a chest in Drakenvale if you didn't get it your first time through."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, so if you want it and didn't already get it from Drakenvale, do so."
  Geomancer:
    - "Now you have a Geomancer. Don't forget an Air Knife from Moore for when you're Wind Slashing."
  Ninja:
    - "The best Ninja weapons you can buy right now are Air Knives from Moore. Nice and easy."
    - "You can also run back to Quelb to buy scrolls, especially if you have access to a good Magic-boosting secondary."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now. I always forget Ninja can wear it. It seems like it should be heavier."
  Bard:
    - "Pick up Requiem from one of the three wolves running around on the right side of Quelb."
    - "Also get Swift Song from the book in Xezat's bedroom in Surgate."
    - "You can play the World 2 pianos now, but you can also wait. No big deal either way."
  Ranger:
    - "There's a good bow in Meatfort, so you don't particularly have to spend gil on the Elven Bow in Moore, but the option is there."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, so if you want it and didn't already get it from Drakenvale, do so."
  Samurai:
    - "The best katana you can buy right now is the Osafune from Surgate's shop."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, so if you want it and didn't already get it from Drakenvale, do so."
  Dragoon:
    - "There's a good lance in Meatfort, so you don't particularly have to spend gil on the Heavy Lance in Surgate, but you also can if you want to."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, so if you want it and didn't already get it from Drakenvale, do so."
  Dancer:
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, so if you want it and didn't already get it from Drakenvale, do so."
    - "The only Ribbon you can have right now is the one from Karnak. No more until World 3, so no worries about trying to find extra."
  Chemist:
    - "Congratulations on your Chemist! Turtle Shells in World 2 drop from Land Turtles on the overworld near Surgate."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, though it's really not that good on Chemist because Succubus's Kiss heals you."
  Freelancer:
    - "Nothing particularly fancy here. It's Freelancer. Put on that Ribbon you've been holding onto since Karnak or whatever else strikes your fancy."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, so if you want it and didn't already get it from Drakenvale, do so."

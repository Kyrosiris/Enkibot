  Generic:
    - "If you're doing a Fifth Job run, now's the time that you get your fifth job. Here are some tips that may help with whatever you have now that you didn't have previously:"
  Knight:
    - "There's a free Great Sword in the Bal castle moat, but you can also just grab some nice stuff in the next dungeon instead."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, so if you want it and didn't already get it from Drakenvale, do so."
  Monk:
    - "Now you have a Monk."
  Thief:
    - "You will be able to steal Reflect Rings in the next dungeon."
  Black-Mage:
    - "Don't forget to go buy spells. Moore has Firaga/Blizzaga/Thundaga/Drain/Break/Bio."
  White-Mage:
    - "Don't forget to go buy spells. Moore has Curaga/Reflect/Berserk/Shell/Esuna/Blink."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "You missed plenty of opportunities to learn things... but there are many more. Here's a quick couple of spells to get before you move on:"
    - "Dark Spark from Strapparer and Death Claw from Treant, both on the overworld outside Meatfort."
    - "If you don't want to wait for Magic Dragons inside Meatfort, you can get Aeroga with a backtrack to Ghido's Cave (from the Metamorph that turns into an Enchanted Fan.)"
    - "(And, if you're on GBA, also grab Vampire from a Dark Aspic while you're in Ghido's Cave.)"
  Berserker:
    - "Please enjoy Krile's cute Berserker costume."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, so if you want it and didn't already get it from Drakenvale, do so."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "If you didn't buy spells already, the Moore black magic vendor has Firaga/Blizzaga/Thundaga/Drain/Break/Bio for your new !Spellblade."
    - "If you didn't have a Bone Mail wearer before, you have one now, so if you want it and didn't already get it from Drakenvale, do so."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Don't forget to go buy spells. Moore has Comet/Hastega/Slowga/Old/Return/Graviga."
    - "If you didn't already do the library puzzle in Surgate, go do that to get Float."
  Summoner:
    - "Don't forget about Golem in the random encounter on the last screen of Drakenvale. He's incredible, and absolutely worth going back for."
    - "You can also go get Catoblepas with the submarine. I have never cast Catoblepas in my life, but if you want to roll the dice on petrifying that one part of the final boss, go for it."
  Red-Mage:
    - "Red Mage, unlike other mages, gets absolutely nothing at this exact moment in time. You actually cannot buy the level 1-3 spells in World 2 at all."
  Beastmaster:
    - "Go get the Kornago Gourd from the old man in the well in Quelb."
    - "There's also the Hypno Crown in a chest in Drakenvale if you didn't get it your first time through."
  Geomancer:
    - "Now you have a Geomancer. Don't forget an Air Knife from Moore for when you're Wind Slashing."
  Ninja:
    - "The best Ninja weapons you can get right now are just Air Knives."
  Bard:
    - "Pick up Requiem from one of the three wolves running around on the right side of Quelb."
    - "You can play the World 2 pianos now, but you can also wait. No big deal either way."
  Ranger:
    - "There's a good bow in Meatfort, so you don't particularly have to spend gil on the Elven Bow in Moore, but the option is there."
  Samurai:
    - "The best katana you can buy right now is the Osafune from Surgate's shop."
  Dragoon:
    - "The best lance you can buy right now is the Heavy Lance from Surgate's shop."
  Dancer:
    - "The only Ribbon you can have right now is the one from Karnak. No more until World 3, so no worries about trying to find one."
  UNION Dancer Blue-Mage:
    - "However, you now have a great source of Confuse to grab White Wind in Meatfort. Just telling you now so you don't forget in a few minutes when you get there."
  Chemist:
    - "Congratulations on your Chemist! Turtle Shells in World 2 drop from Land Turtles on the overworld near Surgate."
  Freelancer:
    - "Nothing particularly fancy here. It's Freelancer. Put on that Ribbon you've been holding onto since Karnak or whatever else strikes your fancy."

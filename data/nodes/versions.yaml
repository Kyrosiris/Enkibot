  Generic:
  - "There are some fairly significant differences in bugs and functionality between the four versions of FFV."
  - "Those versions are 1) SNES [and PS1, and the Project Demi hack] 2) GBA 3) 'Matrix' [the developer of the port, formerly available on iOS, Android, and Steam] and 4) Pixel [console, iOS, Android, and Steam]."
  - "Note that Matrix is not for sale anywhere anymore, which can be a shame for a few specific team comps. In general, you probably want to use something else anyway."
  - "These tips show the applicable ones for your four jobs!"
  Break-Rods:
  - "Pixel seriously buffs rod snapping by removing the multi-target penalty from it, making snapping rods stronger than most summon magic."
  - "In addition, you can snap unequipped rods in the Item menu, allowing you to benefit from the elemental boost of having a rod on when you do snap it! Only a boosted Leviathan would be more powerful."
  Knight:
  - "On Pixel, the Brave Blade formula has been changed to slowly regenerate power over time. So you can flee once in a while. Huge buff."
  Black-Mage:
  - "Due to unspecified formula changes, all-target magic spells deal more damage on Matrix. This makes farming (especially statues) slightly easier. Uncertain about Pixel."
  - "As a trade-off, you can no longer all-target Thundaga on your own party and reflect 3/4 of it onto Omega to bypass its counterattacks. If this is your Omega plan, play SNES or GBA."
  White-Mage:
  - "On SNES and Pixel, Bridge Gilgamesh can be Silenced with Silence. This is a very small change, and you have Protect anyway, so don't let it be the tiebreaker over your personal preference."
  Thief:
  - "On Matrix, Liquid Flame is in the back row, halving all attack damage. If you only have Thieves before the Fire Crystal, this is atrocious for you."
  - "On Matrix and Pixel, you can run even faster with a Thief, stacking with the existing sprint button. Gotta go fast."
  - "On Pixel, you can't run away from the Ramuh fight, denying you an easy source of infinite W1 Hi-Potions. This actually matters if you have no other good job before the Earth Crystal."
  - "On Pixel, Twin Lance + !Mug attempts to steal twice. This is pretty nice. (Other versions unknown.)"
  Monk:
  - "In Matrix, !Kick is not boosted by Kaiser Knuckles, but you weren't wearing those anyway."
  - "On Matrix and Pixel, !Kick works at full power from the back row."
  - "In Pixel, !Focus has full power from the back row. This is HUGE for Garula and generally helpful against other bosses."
  - "In Pixel, !Kick now takes into account the power of whatever weapon you have equipped and ignores whatever properties it has. This is extremely useful, provided they have access to a good Equip ability..."
  - "...AND the Kaiser Knuckles boost that power further, but you probably still weren't wearing those anyway."
  UNION Monk Knight:
  - "Because !Kick ignores all properties of the equipped weapon, Excalipoor is counted as a 100 power weapon and gives Monk some pretty good offense if you have Equip Swords by the time you get it."
  UNION Monk Berserker:
  - "While !Kick with an axe gives consistent damage, it does not apply the axe's defense-quartering damage formula so it's not quite as strong as you'd think."
  UNION Monk Dancer:
  - "Equipping a Ribbon, Rainbow Dress, or Red Slippers will make !Kick and !Focus always hit on top of using the decent damage from the Man Eater."
  Monk`:
  - "Speaking of the Kaiser Knuckles, they buff !Kick damage again in Pixel."  
  UNION Monk Ranger:
  - "But that's not all, a Monk equpping the Kaiser Knuckles will do full power with each of their 8 bare-handed hits when using !Rapid Fire! This matters a lot against high defense enemies but you have to give up your Hermes Sandals for it."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Vampire is bugged on GBA to deal/restore your entire missing health, rather than half. Big improvement!"
  - "On Pixel, being immune to Old doesn't prevent Time Slip from inflicting Sleep. Better against Atomos, for one."
  Time-Mage:
  - "The Matrix and Pixel versions fix 'quickleaking', the glitch where breaking a Venom Rod as your first action on Quick will cause it to tick until you take your second action, so you lose your free Triple Crown."
  - "On SNES, Meteor can hit dummy targets. This makes the final boss harder, because there are two. You want to be on GBA if Time Mage is your best offense for NED."
  Summoner:
  - "In Pixel Odin will either use Zantetsuken or Gungnir regardless of whether any Heavy enemies are present or not. What he uses seems to be random."
  - "This only really affects what to use against Omega as it is no longer a consistent source of unaspected damage. Dispelling its Shell and casting a rod-boosted Ramuh does more damage."
  Red-Mage:
  - "On SNES and Pixel, Bridge Gilgamesh can be Silenced with Silence. This is a very small change, and you do have Protect, so likely don't let it be the tiebreaker over your personal preference."
  Berserker:
  - "On SNES, Berserkers can attack dummy targets. This makes 1-2 Berserker runs significantly worse against Sandworm, Necrophobe, and NED."
  - "On Matrix, Berserkers always attack the default target from selecting 'Attack', typically the first one in the front row. This is really bad for NED because it pushes each piece into enrage mode one by one."
  - "On Matrix and Pixel, Berserkers act independently and don't start battles with empty ATB. This is good."
  - "Basically, GBA/Pixel is down to preference if you only have 1-2 Berserkers. Pixel makes them a little better, but they're still Berserkers, so let your other classes decide."
  - "Once you have 3+ Berserkers, the best damage output will be on SNES - utilizing the Thornlet magic underflow glitch makes your Gaia Hammer Berserker an all-star."
  Geomancer:
  - "!Gaia results are level-independent on Matrix, but not any of the three versions you can actually buy."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "On Pixel, Sleep Spellblade wakes up an already-sleeping target. This makes fights where you want to use it more difficult but also doesn't really matter that much. You can keep an enemy asleep by having two characters repeatedly hitting the same target with Sleep Spellblades."
  - "In Pixel, -aga level !Spellblades still do 4x damage to Heavy targets weak to the relevant element but no longer pierce their physical defense. This shouldn't matter if you're holding the Chicken Knife, but may matter otherwise."
  Beastmaster:
  - "!Calm is only bugged on GBA, so you lose your free Triple Crown if you use other versions."
  Ranger:
  - "!Rapid Fire can attack dummy targets on SNES. This makes runs with Ranger significantly better against Necrophobe and NED (and technically Sandworm (do not !Rapid Fire the Sandworm)) in every other version."
  - "!Animals results are level-independent on Matrix, but not any of the three versions you can actually buy."
  Bard:
  - "Songs raise numbers to a maximum of 255 on Matrix/Pixel, versus 99 on SNES/GBA. This doesn't matter in practice, but you can make even more hilariously large numbers."
  - "Tree-form Exdeath's physical attacks don't break !Sing on SNES or GBA, but do on Matrix and Pixel, which makes the final fight slightly safer on Pixel."
  - "Hero's Rime blocks other non-Rime level changes on Pixel. This is worse if you also have Chemist, but better against Dischord/Old."
  - "On the SNES and GBA versions, there's an interesting glitch where if you 1) have a Bard sing a stat boosting song, then 2) put them to Sleep with a spell and 3) wake them up, the song they're singing will continue ticking upwards despite them being free to act."
  - "If they sing another stat song, the first song will go away, so you want to do other actions like dealing damage or singing songs like Romeo's Ballad. Or !Hide. Yes, they keep singing while hidden."
  - "This is easiest with a Black or Red Mage buddy that can cast the spell Sleep. Theoretically a reflected Sleep proc from the Sleep Blade would work but... that's unlikely at best."
  - "!Hide doesn't run enemies out of MP on Pixel. They get refunds for anything cast with no targets. Mostly relevant against W2 Exdeath and Omniscient, if at all."
  - "In Pixel, harps deal double damage to enemies that are always hit by them although it doesn't pierce magic defense. There are next to no enemies of consequence affected except for Bahamut, Calofisteri, and Omega (although it is now reflectable!)"
  - "This stacks with the Apollo's Harp's damage bonus against dragons but there are literally no enemies that are weak both to harps and are dragons..."
  UNION Bard Chemist:
  - "...unless you !Mix a Dragon's Kiss which will end up doing huge, but not magic defense-ignoring damage."
  UNION Bard Blue-Mage:
  - "Time Slip can trigger the singing glitch but it will Old your Bard, so take that into consideration. Also make sure they aren't immune to Old or Time Slip will fail entirely!"
  UNION Bard Ranger:
  - "!Rapid Fire doesn't work with harps on Pixel. This probably doesn't matter, but it was one of the best Shinryu offense options..."
  Ninja:
  - "If you don't have a better Chicken Knife user, Dual Wielding a Twin Lance in the mainhand will disable the !Flee proc on SNES and GBA, but not Matrix/Pixel."
  - "If you do have a better Chicken Knife user, the Dancing Dagger's Sword Dance proc triggers a Dance from both weapons, not just one, on Matrix/Pixel."
  - "Equipping a Twin Lance on the mainhand and a Thief Knife on the other will make !Mug procs attempt to steal twice."
  Chemist:
  - "The Death Potion !Mix is blockable on Matrix, so Chemists are better on SNES or GBA."
  - "Some(?) !Mixes are newly blockable on Pixel. Death Potion is still not. Succubus Kiss is also unblockable AND doesn't provoke counters to boot, so you can murder Omega and Omniscient with even more ease than before."
  Samurai:
  - "!Mineuchi is correctly coded on Matrix and Pixel: only half power, but actually will Paralyze. It DOES bypass Chicken Knife procs on Pixel, but DOES NOT on SNES/GBA/Matrix."
  - "You're trading off damage (on an ability you'll never use) for the ability to paralyze random encounters, Titan, Carbuncle, the Gargoyles, Melusine, Catastrophe, and the Vacuum Wave part of NED."
  - "Those bosses are all heavy (or optional), so the Paralyze will be almost useless, but it is a point to consider, I guess."
  Dancer:
  - "Sword Dance does full damage from back row in Pixel. Enjoy being more defensive for free!"
  - "For some reason, !Dance doesn't trigger Omniscient's counters on Pixel. What."
  - "On Pixel, wearing a Ribbon, a Rainbow Dress, or Red Slippers (not Lamia's Tiara or Man-Eater, just those three) makes that character's physical attacks always hit. Great for Berserkers! Theoretically useful against Omega too, if you can endure the counters."
  Mime:
  - "Pixel added a later-FF style button to switch between party members with full ATB bars. Which is good if you want to !Mimic something in particular."
  INTERSECTION Ranger Beastmaster Berserker Freelancer:
  - "In Pixel, bows, whips, and the Thor's Hammer deal double damage to enemies that would always be hit by them although it does not pierce defense. This mostly includes flying enemies but also a handful of bosses, most notably Tree Exdeath."
  - "This stacks on top of damage bonuses on certain weapons like the Artemis Bow although this won't come up very much in practice..."
  UNION Beastmaster Chemist:
  - "...unless you !Mix a Dragon's Kiss at any of these enemies and hit them with a Dragon Whisker."
  UNION Freelancer Chemist:
  - "...unless you !Mix a Dragon's Kiss at any of these enemies and hit them with a Dragon Whisker."
  INTERSECTION Cannoneer Oracle Gladiator:
  - "If you have an Advance job, play GBA. Duh."
  Generic`:
  - "Finally, a few party-agnostic notes:"
  - "If you lose levels to Dischord/Old, and then die, and then get resurrected, those levels come back in Pixel, but not the other versions. It may be a valid tactic to intentionally kill off and then revive affected party members to reset their stats."
  - "On Pixel, Weight lowers your agility at a ratio of 4 Weight = -1 Agility. On all other versions, it's 8 Weight = -1 Agility. Defense isn't worth the speed loss - even heavy armor jobs should use the lightest armor possible."
  - "In Pixel for some reason, weapons that increase Magic will also increase Weight by the same amount. For example a Blood Sword's +5 Magic also gives +5 Weight. The Mage Masher, Enhancer, and Rune Axe are exceptions and have no Weight." 
  - "Incremental/decremental effects tick a lot slower in Pixel. This particularly affects Bard songs, Old level loss, Sap damage, and Doom countdown timers."
  - "Weapons that deal magic-based damage such as the Apollo's Harp, Blood Sword, and most staves, are reflectable in Pixel."

  Generic:
  - "Optional superboss! No reason other than bragging rights (and a shiny circle on your Fiesta page) to try this."
  - "To pull this off at a sane level, you need both a way to neuter its offense and a way to actually deal damage."
  - "Without cheese but with good sandbagging classes like WHM or BLU, you can try to fight it out normally..."
  - "...but many parties don't even have a way to damage Omega through its 190 defense, 150 magic defense, Reflect, Shell, 7 elemental absorbs, 95% physical evasion, and 90% magic evasion."
  - "In Pixel, you can Dispel its Shell but NOT its Reflect."
  - "If you're going to rely on magic damage that doesn't pierce its huge magic defense, you'll need WHM, a Judgment Staff, or a Wonder Wand to remove its Shell."
  Bard:
  - "Omega is vulnerable to being stopped by Romeo's Ballad. (Except on Matrix.)"
  - "Two hasted Bards can keep a full lock going while a third sings your speed up to 99."
  - "After maximizing speed, one Bard can keep lockdown going while the other two sing Hero's Rime and your stat buff song of choice."
  - "Then attack without fear of counterattacks."
  INTERSECTION Freelancer Bard:
  - "In Pixel, the Apollo's Harp will always hit Omega and deal double damage but since it is a magic-based attack, it will be Reflected back at you."
  - "Even if you could Reflect it back, it'll do pitiful damage even with Omega's Shell dispelled since it doesn't pierce its magic defense..."
  UNION Bard Chemist:
  - "...but if you !Mix Dragon's Kiss onto Omega, the harp weakness damage will stack with the Dragon-effectiveness damage and it will do HUGE damage."
  - "Make sure you Dispel Omega's Shell with Judgment Staff first to get most out of this damage. This may save you some Turtle Soup !Mixes along the way."
  UNION Freelancer Chemist:
  - "...but if you !Mix Dragon's Kiss onto Omega, the harp weakness damage will stack with the Dragon-effectiveness damage and it will do HUGE damage, especially if a good magic stat is passed onto your Freelancer."
  - "Make sure you Dispel Omega's Shell with Judgment Staff first to get most out of this damage. This may save you some Turtle Soup !Mixes along the way."
  Beastmaster:
  - "On GBA, Omega is vulnerable to being stopped by !Calm."
  - "Three hasted Beastmasters can keep a full lock going while your fourth party member attacks without fear of counterattacks."
  - "Beastmasters can release Yellow Dragons for 9999 each."
  - "Crystal Dragons use Strong Fight in Pixel which also does 9999 and are more common encounters in the Void (23%) than Yellow Dragons (6%) in the Dimension Castle."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Time Mages can use the 'quickleak' technique (Quick+use Venom Rod+sit there with second action prompt up) to kill Omega very, very slowly on everything but Pixel."
  - "Since this takes a few real-life hours, you may not want to attempt this on an actual physical SNES/GBA/iDevice."
  - "Meteor and Comet deal unaspected damage and ignore reflects."
  - "...Unless they roll fantastically high, however, they'll get completely nullified by Omega's sky-high Magic Defense."
  - "Quickleaking is really it for Time Mage without other job's offensive options."
  Chemist:
  - "Chemists can pretty much make themselves invulnerable to every single one of Omega's attacks."
  - "That's not literally true, since you can still die to two Wave Cannons in a row without a turn of your own to heal in between. But that is literally the only thing that can kill you."
  - "See, for example, sullla's solo Chemist log at http://www.sullla.com/FF/omegashinryuu.html"
  - "Hint: Start by !Mixing five Turtle Soups to drop Omega's defense and magic defense to 1 each."
  Pierce-Def:
  - "Piercing defense is a start - criticals and axes are okay starting ideas if there's no better plan."
  Black-Mage:
  - "Black Mages can reflect a Thundaga off allies to bypass Omega's innate Reflect."
  - "If you're on Pixel, make sure you Dispel its Shell to increase your damage output. Use the Wonder Wand if you must."
  - "On SNES and GBA, reflecting off 3 allies and hitting the fourth (ideally someone with Diamond Armor on to take less damage) won't trigger Omega's brutal counters."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Blue Mages can chip Omega down with 1000 Needles and heal through the counterattacks with White Wind (and Mighty Guard)."
  - "This is awful, but technically feasible."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Thundaga !Spellblade does a lot of damage to Omega. 4x attack, ignores defense... and still misses a lot if you don't have another way to guarantee that you hit."
  - "In Pixel, Thundaga !Spellblade still does 4x attack but doesn't pierce defense, so be sure to equip the Chicken Knife if you weren't already holding it."
  Ranger:
  - "!Rapid Fire ignores defense and never misses. It does however, cause 2 counterattacks. (4 in Pixel! Watch out!)"
  Dragoon:
  - "Dragoons can chip away with the Trident, a spear that does lightning damage."
  - "Even with !Jump, this will take ages. Consider not doing it."
  Summoner:
  - "Summoners can either hit Omega's weakness with a rod-boosted Ramuh or deal unaspected damage with Odin."
  - "Since Odin can randomly attempt Zantetsuken in Pixel, Ramuh will deal more, consistent damage if you can Dispel the auto-Shell first. Use a Wonder Wand if you have to."
  INTERSECTION Knight Red-Mage Gladiator: 
  - "Anyone who can use a sword can technically damage Omega with the Coral Sword."
  INTERSECTION Dancer Freelancer:
  - "In Pixel, anyone equipped with a Ribbon, Rainbow Dress, or Red Slippers can always hit Omega with physical attacks, bypassing its evasion."
  UNION Dancer Mystic-Knight:
  - "This is necessary to ensure your Thundaga !Spellblades hit."
  UNION Freelancer Mystic-Knight:
  - "This is necessary to ensure your Thundaga !Spellblades hit."
  UNION Ninja Dancer:
  - "On SNES and GBA, mainhand Chicken Knife + any offhand weapon that does 0 damage (like your starting Knife) lets you Swords Dance without triggering counterattacks."
  Gladiator:
  - "Since there's no character with a Lightning-elemental !Finisher, there's no actually good option for GLD to damage Omega."
  - "GLD's best option is the Trident, 1 point of attack higher than the Coral Sword. This still isn't worth it without !Jump to double its damage, and DRG wouldn't want to do that, so GLD shouldn't either."
  Cannoneer:
  - "You can inflict Slow on Omega with the awesome power of your cannon. (You eat a counterattack for this. It's worth it.)"
  - "Vulner Cannon and Chaos Cannon don't provoke counterattacks, so you have good damage options too."

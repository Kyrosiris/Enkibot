  Generic:
  - "Image guide: https://i.imgur.com/newtN7c.png"
  - "Biggest threats are: Grand Cross (random ailments), Almagest (1620-1665 holy damage + Sap status), enrage (last part living uses every part's bad stuff, plus gets two attacks per turn.)"
  - "Grand Cross can be mitigated with Hermes Sandals, Aegis Shield, and luck. Most parties will kill Grand Cross first to lower the number of dice rolls."
  - "Almagest is a HP check. Unless you have extreme damage output and rush it first, you will need the HP, or Shell, to survive it."
  - "You can skip enrage either by counting HP and killing the last 2 parts at the same time..."
  - "...or by saving the bottom left (non-Heavy) part for last, then killing it with Odin from the Magic Lamp."
  Break-Rods:
  - "Even without !White, you get one free Shell cast from the Wonder Wand."
  Berserker:
  - "In the SNES version, there are two 'dummy' targets in the fight that will cause your Berserker to miss a lot. You will probably be better served equipping the Earth Hammer and Thornlet to underflow your magic stat."
  - "In the GBA and Pixel versions, the dummy targets are gone, making the Rune Axe much more reliable."
  - "In the Matrix version, Berserkers attack targets in a nice orderly fashion... which is actually awful if you're trying to avoid the enrage mode. Play around it."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Congratulations! Mystic Knights don't care about Almagest. Break Blade kills that part with perfect accuracy."
  Time-Mage:
  - "If things go seriously south, Quick is a good recovery tool to throw out two Phoenix Downs/Remedies/Elixirs in one turn."
  - "On SNES, your Meteors will be weaker than expected, due to the presence of two 'dummy' targets."
  - "If you're a gambling sort, you can try to land Old on the Almagest part at *extremely* low odds."
  - "You can also, with even more gambling (and high levels) involved, attempt to Banish the leftmost part. Not very practical, but absolutely hilarious."
  Dragoon:
  - "The Dragon Lance is super-effective against the Grand Cross part, if you stole one (please do not waste the effort just for this.)"
  - "Almagest is telegraphed by Neo Exdeath beginning to shake, and Grand Cross is telegraphed by the warning 'The laws of the universe mean nothing!'. A well-timed !Jump can dodge those."
  Dancer:
  - "You'll probably have to look elsewhere for damage, but Equip Ribbons make Grand Cross almost completely safe."
  - "The Man-Eater deals critical damage to the left-most part (the one that dies to Magic Lamp Odin, so this tip isn't great, but it's what you've got to work with.)"
  - "Beyond that, it's Sword Dance all the way."
  Chemist:
  - "Chemists want to lean on spamming Holy Breath (Dragon Fang + Holy Water). It does damage equal to your HP, which combos with Goliath Tonic doubling your max HP."
  - "Between Goliath Tonic and the ability to Shell the whole team, Chemists can neuter Almagest."
  - "Dragon's Kiss (Dragon Fang + Maiden's Kiss) also grants immunity from Grand Cross's 'HP Critical' result." 
  Samurai:
  - "You will need an obscene amount of gil to kill NED with just !Zeninage, but it's conceptually simple."
  - "If you have an easy way to kill them, the Movers in the last room of the void drop 50k gil each and come in packs of three."
  Thief:
  - "Remember that the weapons you can steal off of NED's parts (Ragnarok, Dragon Lance, Murakumo) can be equipped mid-battle."
  UNION Thief Ninja:
  - "...or thrown by your Ninja."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters can release a Dragon Aevis for a 9999-all-target Breath Wing. 4 of them will get NED's parts real low."
  - "You can also release a Crystelle for Mighty Guard to trivialize Almagest, but catching one's a horrible pain (and literally impossible without the Kornago Gourd, since they have 3 HP.)"
  - "Anyone under level 45 attacking with the Dancing Dagger in the back row targeting a Crystelle that you have !Controlled to use Protect on itself first can get to the necessary 2 damage."
  - "Alternatively, if you have an Excalipoor wielder, that's going to be way easier. Way way way easier."
  - "The Beast Killer whip does 8x damage on the Almagest part of NED, since it's a Magical Beast."
  - "The Dragon Whisker whip is also super effective on the Grand Cross part of NED, since it's a Dragon.
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Mighty Guard and White Wind allow you to win stand-up brawls against NED with little fuss."
  - "Or you could abuse Dark Spark and Level 5 Death, but honestly it's not really worth the setup time thanks to the level-based magic accuracy formula making the first few successful Sparks take forever."
  UNION Blue-Mage Chemist:
  - "Unless you have !Mix AND math both on your side, which lets you set up the hilarious QUAD SKULL by taking all parts to level 255."
  Blue-Mage`:
  - "Condemn works on the far-left part, if you don't want to just Magic Lamp it, or if you think that telling the final boss it has 30 seconds to live is hilarious (it is.)"
  - "The top-left part, which casts Grand Cross, can be locked down by Paralyze from Mind Blast. That said, it has 75% magic evasion and is high level to boot, so it's likely not worth the effort."
  - "On Pixel, theoretically you can land Old from Time Slip on the Almagest part, but the odds will be incredibly low thanks to its magic evasion and high level."
  Bard:
  - "Apollo's Harp does 8x damage against the Grand Cross part, if for some reason your party isn't 99 speed/level 255 anyway."
  - "...but they should be, since you buffed all your stats to maximum at the start of the Treedeath phase of the fight, right?"
  Ranger:
  - "The top-right Melee part (the one that chucks out 1800 damage Vacuum Waves) can be blinded by Dark Bow."
  - "On SNES, the two 'dummy' targets make !Rapid Fire less reliable."
  - "The Artemis Bow is super effective against the Almagest part of NED, since it's a Magical Beast."
  Summoner:
  - "An actual !Summoned Odin will not work on the leftmost part, as he will use Gungnir if any enemy on the field is Heavy."
  - "In Pixel a !Summoned Odin CAN potentially use Zantetsuken on the leftmost part, but it's infinitely easier and more consistent to just use Magic Lamp Odin instead."
  - "Boosted Syldras can probably end this fight before it really begins. Load !Summon and Air Knives on everyone."
  Ninja:
  - "Scrolls are still good AoE if backed up by a magic ability."
  - "Now is the time to throw the legendary weapons you aren't using for good single-target damage. Fuma Shurikens are stronger, though."
  Geomancer:
  - "!Gaia will always use Wind Slash here. Boost it with Air Knife or Rune Chime, and it'll do reasonable AoE damage."
  Monk:
  - "Unless you did a lot of grinding, your fists won't do much here. Just settle for a beefy Elixir dispenser, or use some other class's secondary."
  - "HP +30% can help other classes survive Almagest, though, and an actual Monk almost always will."
  - "If you have access to a good Equip ability and a strong weapon in Pixel, !Kick can do respectable AoE damage safely from the back row."
  White-Mage:
  - "Blink is good against the physicals/Vacuum Waves. Shell is great against Almagest. You know the drill."
  INTERSECTION Summoner Black-Mage:
  - "If you're having trouble killing the Almagest part before it kills you, you can attempt (at fairly low odds) to Petrify it."
  - "At sane levels, you've got about an 8% shot per cast. It's low, but can save you a bunch of grinding in return for a bunch of RNG."
  Black-Mage:
  - "AoE damage makes it pretty easy to kill the last two parts at the same time."
  - "If you go with this method, though, keep in mind that the rightmost part has 5000 less HP than the middle parts."
  - "Alternatively, the leftmost part has 5000 more than the middle ones, and dies to Magic Lamp Odin, so you can leave it for last on purpose."
  Red-Mage:
  - "At least you can put up Protect for Almagest...?"
  - "Raise+Cura isn't the *worst*, but offensively, on its own, RDM is probably breaking rods for this entire fight. Especially on Pixel, where you get to break BOOSTED rods."
  - "Hopefully you have another class that can use !Dualcast and can pick up the slack."
  Knight:
  - "Aegis Shield protects against a few Grand Cross outcomes, and can block Almagest, but you were wearing it anyway."
  - "If you have the Defender from Fork Tower, you can use it to apply Protect to help mitigate Vacuum Wave, if you're worried."
  UNION Knight Thief:
  - "You can steal a Ragnarok in this fight, and then swap it in to wield it without having to fight Shinryu, but it's a rare steal so it may not be worth your time."
  - "...and this is relevant because if you have Knight and Thief, your odds of being able to fight Shinryu are not great."
  Freelancer:
  - "If all else fails, you have access to Apollo's Harp (top middle part), Man-Eater (leftmost part), and Artemis Bow (bottom middle part) for 8x, 2x, and 2x !Attack damage respectively."
  - "Wearing a Ribbon is great against Grand Cross, plus you have Aegis Shield access."
  Cannoneer:
  - "The physical attack part (rightmost) and the magic part (leftmost) are vulnerable to Slow."
  - "All four parts are vulnerable to Darkness, but only the far-right one actually matters, because that one physically attacks."
  - "The Almagest part (bottom middle) is vulnerable to Old, which will completely nerf its Almagest damage."
  - "The Grand Cross part (top middle) is a Dragon, so it will take double damage from Dragon Cannon, which might do more than Needle Cannon at sane levels."
  - "Between the Lamp, Darkness+Slow, and Old, the only part you don't outright neuter is the Grand Cross part... and for some reason CAN gets Aegis Shield access."
  Gladiator:
  - "Fishing for 9999 !Finisher hits will probably average more damage than !Bladeblitz, but either should be fine because Gladiator has lots of weapon options and LOTS of Strength."
  Oracle:
  - "Uh... just do whatever you've been doing all game. Probably with your other three jobs, honestly."
  - "You can land Condemn on the leftmost part to kill it with Doom. (The one that dies to Magic Lamp Odin anyway.) If you wanted something to do with specifically your Oracle, there you go."

    previous-nodes: ['versions']
  Generic:
    - "Most classes will not need to purchase gear in Tule to beat Karlabos, but it's cheap."
  Beastmaster:
    - "If you plan on releasing it against the Antlion, don't open the Goblin-trapped chest in the Training House."
  Bard:
    - "Play the piano in the Pub for your Bard."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "You can revisit the pirate cave now and learn Vampire from the bats there."
    - "Also, you should definitely get Aero from the Moldwynds in the Wind Shrine and probably also Goblin Punch from the Black Goblins."
    - "The next boss is level 5 if you want to specifically match levels for the 8x Goblin Punch damage bonus."
  White-Mage:
    - "To save yourself some gil, don't forget the hidden Staff in the lower-right corner of Floor 4 of the Wind Shrine."
  Monk:
    - "If you are playing Pixel, immediately move all your Monks to the back row. !Kick and !Focus have no penalty from the back which is worth the halved Counter damage."
    - "You will get decent mileage !Kick-spamming trash and safely hitting some upcoming bosses with !Focus (notably Garula and Forza)." 
    - "Just be aware !Kick can't crit and you will do more damage to a single target with !Focus or front row !Fight."

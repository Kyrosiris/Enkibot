  Generic:
  - "13000 effective HP, spams the same old Blue Magic + new status aliments."
  - "Totally optional, if you don't need the Genji Helmet and, later, the Genji Armor."
  - "He won't show up in the Void or to help you fight Necrophobe if you skip this, though."
  - "This fight's not difficult enough to bother doing anything fancy. Just attack him and heal if needed."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters can go downstairs and !Catch a Yellow Dragon, which will carve off 9999 HP thanks to Gilgamesh's inflated true HP total."
  Dragoon:
  - "Don't forget the Partisan in a chest to the right of the Gilgamesh room. It's the highest-power spear you can get at this point, and also not elemental."
  Ninja:
  - "Don't forget the free Fuma Shuriken in a chest to the right of the Gilgamesh room."
  Generic`:
  - "The Excalipoor is a funny joke weapon."
  - "It has a listed power of 100, but it will always do 1 damage and never miss when used with !Fight and most commands."
  - "Nonetheless it has a few niche uses, some of which go around its fixed damage if you have the means for it."
  Ninja`:
  - "!Throw only cares about a weapon's listed power, so it is a powerful weapon to fling in an emergency."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Goblin Punch makes you do a physical attack that bypasses the fixed damage, never misses, and works from the back row."
  UNION Monk+Knight:
  - "In Pixel, a Monk with !Kick and Equip Swords holding an Excalipoor ignores the fixed damage, so you have an amusingly strong offensive, AoE option."
  Beastmaster`: 
  - "You won't care for a long time but if you have a sword-user among your party, it'll make catching Crystelles in the Void much easier for their Mighty Guard !Release."
  Generic``:
  - "Push comes to shove, you can always equip it in battle to safely knock someone out of sleep/confusion."

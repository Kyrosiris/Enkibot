  Generic:
  - "It's pretty rare for any Fiesta party to care about the Deep Sea Trench. Consider skipping it."
  INTERSECTION Oracle Cannoneer Gladiator:
  - "It's required to unlock Oracle, Cannoneer, and Gladiator. Sorry."
  Bard:
  - "Bard parties might appreciate the Trench solely for the novelty of vaporizing its 100% undead inhabitants with Requiem."
  - "Not a bad way to grind out XP/ABP/gil, but with Bard you don't need that much grinding."
  Monk:
  - "Monks can get the Kaiser Knuckles here, which improves their damage from pathetic to mediocre."
  - "It also competes for the accessory slot with Hermes Sandals, so you'll literally never use it."
  UNION Monk Ranger:
  - "If you're playing on Pixel, a Monk with Kaiser Knuckles using !Rapid Fire will do 8 full power hits. Amazing as this is, it's still probably not worth the trouble going all the way here just for these."
  - "Consider going to Istory Falls to farm Steel Fists for a Kaiser Knuckles drop instead if you have no other reason to be here."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Meteor is locked behind the Deep Sea Trench, so you actually want to do it for Time Mages."

    previous-nodes: ['north_mountain']
  Generic:
    - "Magissa has 650 HP and alternates between black magic and [Drain or Fight]. On her first turn after reaching 300 HP, she summons Forza."
    - "Forza has 850 HP and can easily one-shot a squishy character in the front row with physical attacks."
  White-Mage:
    - "It's possible to sandbag your way through Magissa's 200 MP before she summons Forza."
    - "Or you can just Silence her, refresh it periodically, and not care about her MP."
    - "Don't forget to cast Protect on everyone before Forza arrives."
  Thief:
    - "Bring a lot of Potions if you have 4 Thieves. There's no real way to finesse this fight."
    - "If you're really in trouble, grind to level 16. With 4 Daggers, you can bring Magissa from 320 to dead (which skips Forza) in one barrage of four back-to-back !Fights."
  Break-Rods:
    - "You can snap the Frost Rod from Carwen here. Killing Magissa in one shot when she has >300 HP skips Forza entirely."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "If you're not going to abuse rod snapping, you can blind Forza with Flash."
  Black-Mage:
    - "If you're not going to abuse rod snapping, you can Sleep Forza and unload on Magissa."
    - "Spells won't wake Forza up, so he'll die quickly too."
